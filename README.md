# LLM-Powered Customer Chat Analysis

This is a Streamlit dashboard that transforms raw customer conversations into **clean summaries, sentiment scores, and actionable insights** using GPT.  

This project demonstrates:
- **Prompt engineering** for structured LLM outputs  
- **LLM output parsing** and workflow automation  
- **Data exploration & visualization** in Streamlit

## How to Run Locally

Clone this repo & run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
## ðŸ“¡ Deployment

This app is deployed on Streamlit Cloud. You can fork and redeploy your own version easily by:

1. Forking the repo
2. Visiting [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io)
3. Connecting to your GitHub repo
4. Setting the main file as `app.py`

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

The **AI Insight** column contains LLM-generated responses with 3 parts:

- **Customer Summary**
- **Sentiment** (e.g. Angry, Positive, Frustrated)
- **Suggested Action**

The app parses the **Sentiment** and enables filtering, grouping, and visualization to make sense of high-volume customer feedback.
